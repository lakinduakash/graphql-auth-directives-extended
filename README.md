# graphql-auth-directives-extended

Add authentication to your GraphQL API with schema directives. Provides options for improved managing of permissions, 
also for non-authenticated users, and manages conditional permission performing Neo4j lookups based on user defined 
queries. You can also provide your own permission schema that represent which scopes granted to roles.

## Schema directives for authorization

- [ ] `@isAuthenticated`
- [ ] `@hasRole`
- [ ] `@hasScope`

## Quick start

```sh
npm install --save graphql-auth-user-directives
```

Then import the schema directives you'd like to use and attach them during your GraphQL schema construction. For example using [neo4j-graphql.js' `makeAugmentedSchema`](https://grandstack.io/docs/neo4j-graphql-js-api.html#makeaugmentedschemaoptions-graphqlschema):


```js
import { IsAuthenticatedDirective, HasRoleDirective, HasScopeDirective } from "graphql-auth-directives-extended";

const augmentedSchema = makeAugmentedSchema({
  typeDefs,
  schemaDirectives: {
    isAuthenticated: IsAuthenticatedDirective,
    hasRole: HasRoleDirective,
    hasScope: HasScopeDirective
  }
});
```

The `@hasRole`, `@hasScope`, and `@isAuthenticated` directives will now be available for use in your GraphQL schema:

```
type Query {
    userById(userId: ID!): User @hasScope(scopes: ["User:Read"])
    itemById(itemId: ID!): Item @hasScope(scopes: ["Item:Read"])
}
```

Be sure to inject the request headers into the GraphQL resolver context. For example, with Apollo Server:

```js
const server = new ApolloServer({
  schema,
  context: ({ req }) => {
    return req;
  }
});
```

In the case that the token was decoded without errors the `context.user` will store the payload from the token, that is, you could for example create a Query `me` with the following resolver:

```js
me: (parent, args, context) => {
      console.log(context.user.id);
}
```

## Configure

### JSON based permission schema (optional)
You might provide scopes directly to the encoded user. However you may also control the scopes of a role within your backend, changing it with either enviromental variable (`PERMISSIONS=base64_encoded_json`) or directly load the json object by calling `loadPermissionSchema($json)`. `loadPermissionSchema` must be called befor initilising the `schemaDirectives`. This will oevrride the environment variable `PERMISSIONS`. With this approach you do not depend on another system to refresh scopes.   
To do so you need to define a JSON specified file, e.g.
```json
{
  "role1": ["resource1:action1", "resource2:action2"],
  "role2": ["resource3:action3", "resource4:action4"]
}
```

### Setting the authorization header name
By default the package looks at the header name 'authorization' (capital letter sensitive). However you may specify the environment variable `AUTHORIZATION_HEADER` allowing for example for a header name like 'Application-Authorization', i.e.

```sh
export AUTHORIZATION_HEADER=Aplication-Authorization 
```

### Setting the JWT token (required)

There are two variables to control how tokens are processed.
If you would like the server to verify the tokens used in a request, you must provide the secret used to encode the token in the `JWT_SECRET` variable. Otherwise you will need to set `JWT_NO_VERIFY` to true.

```sh
export JWT_NO_VERIFY=true //Server does not have the secret, but will need to decode tokens
```
or
```sh
export JWT_SECRET=><YOUR_JWT_SECRET_KEY_HERE> //Server has the secret and will verify authenticity
```

Assuming your user has a provided role, this package will determine the corresponding permissions. To insert this JSON file you'll need to base64 encode it to add is as an environment variable, e.g.
```sh
export PERMISSIONS=ewogICJyb2xlMSI6IFsicmVzb3VyY2UxOmFjdGlvbjEiLCAicmVzb3VyY2UyOmFjdGlvbjIiXSwKICAicm9sZTIiOiBbInJlc291cmNlMzphY3Rpb24zIiwgInJlc291cmNlNDphY3Rpb240Il0KfQ==
```
Note that a user might have multiple roles, in this case all permissions of the corresponding roles will be concatenated, providing the expected results.  
Furthermore, if you work with such permission JSON you can provide a default user, e.g. the role that will be applied if authentication fails. Specify the user in your JSON and provide the name of the role as an environment variable, e.g.:
```sh
export DEFAULT_ROLE=visitor
```
This option allows you to specify a clear set of permissions for non-authenticated users.  
Finally, in some cases the roles and or scopes in the decoded user object may come with an url such as `https://grandstack.io/roles` and `https://grandstack.io/scopes`, you can map these to `roles` and `scopes` respectively in your final user by providing the meta names comma separated, e.g.
```sh
export USER_METAS="roles,scopes"
```

### Conditional permissions (optional)
This package includes a conditional based authorisation functionality, for example: a mutation may have the scope 
`object: edit`, however you only wish some user to provide access if he/she is the owner of this object, the scope for 
this user might be `object: edit: isOwner` (this is also the way to define such permission, using another `:` and 
specifying the condition, however you'd like to name it).  
What you need to do is configure a query that is needed to check on whether this user is the owner. 

```$xslt
import { conditionalQueryMap } from 'graphql-auth-user-directives';

conditionalQueryMap.set(
    "object:isOwner",
    (user, objectId) => { return `
    MATCH path=(a:Object {uid: "${objectId}"})<-[:OWNS]-(u:User {uid:"${user.uid}"})
    WITH CASE WHEN path IS NULL THEN false ELSE true END as is_allowed
    ` }
);
```

Three things are important to note:
1. The key used to set the map is set the name of the object (in this example `object`), and the condition (in this case 
`isOwner`) separated by a `:`.
2. You should end the Cypher query with a `WITH` statement that defines a variable called `is_allowed`.
3. The function defined returns a string (the query used to perform the permission lookup in Neo4j) and it gets two 
input arguments, the user as it is decoded and the objectId which is strongly related to the object itself. See the next 
part on the object identifier.  

The conditional permissions do not have to be specified in the schema, if one defines 
`@hasScope(scopes: ["object: edit"]` for a query or mutation, then if the user has a the permission 
`object: edit: someCondition` then this condition will be verified by default.

#### Defining the Object identifier
This object id is extracted from the provided parameters in Apollo. Usually it will be `id` or `uid`. By default we 
provide preference for `id` followed by `uid`. You can change this by setting the environment variable 
`OBJECT_IDENTIFIER`. By default it is thus set to the string `"id", "uid"`.  

#### Separately checking conditional permissions
You may want to verify conditional permissions separately, e.g. to check whether the frontend should present a piece of 
code. Therefore you can now call the conditional permission check function:

```$xslt
// Example of how this function could be used in a Query
import { satisfiesConditionalScopes } from "graphql-auth-user-directives";

exports.resolver = {
    Query: {
        checkConditionalPermission: async (obj, params, ctx, resolveInfo) => {
            // (optional) First check if scopes are defined for the user
            const userScopes = ctx.user && ctx.user.scopes;
            if(userScopes == null){
                throw new UserInputError("You have no scopes and therefore no access");
            }

            // params.scopes contains the array of conditional scopes that should be checked.
            return await satisfiesConditionalScopes(
                ctx.driver, params.scopes, userScopes, ctx.user, params.objectId
            );
        }
    }
}
```

Note that it is a more trivial exercise to verify non-conditional scopes for this is merely a direct lookup in the 
scopes of the user. Therefore this is not expected to be required to be exported.

## Client configuration

A JWT must then be included in each GraphQL request in the Authorization header. For example, with Apollo Client:

```js
import { createHttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http';
import { setContext } from 'apollo-link-context';
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';
import { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client';


const httpLink = createHttpLink({
    uri: <YOUR_GRAPHQL_API_URI>
});

const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem('id_token'); // here we are storing the JWT in localStorage
    return {
        headers: {
            ...headers,
            authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : "",
        }
    }
});

const client = new ApolloClient({
    link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
    cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

If all is set up correctly you should be able to use the directives and resolvers that use any of these directives the roles and/or permissions will be attached to the user which is provided in the context.

## Running Tests Locally

You'll need to set node 13 or higher (due to the triple dot operator).
```sh
nvm use 13
```
Then run the tests by performing
```sh
yarn test
```

The JWT secret, permissions and metas required for testing are all defined in the `.env` file.
